This was a program that I completed for my ICS 211 class from Leeward Community College. This was one of the programming classes that did not have a midterm, but instead had a middle of the semester programming project. Tic Tac Toe was the minigame we had to implement thru Java using JFrame and its functions. I found this to be extremely challenging for me because I had not gotten used to all the different methods and syntax surrounding JFrame, but after help from the professor and YouTube tutorials, I was able to get started.

The project was a very simple tic tac toe game that would open a new window on your computer and you will play against the program. The program was based around selecting a random tile after the user selects their tile, and first player to lock in three selections in a row gets the win. This project relied heavily on skills in object orientated programming because JFrame was a class, so this project definitely honed my skills working in object orientated programming languages for future work.
