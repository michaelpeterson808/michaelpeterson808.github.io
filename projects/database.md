summary: "A project that demonstrates my knowledge in C and C++. Using linked lists it creates a database that is able to save data for multiple uses. With the multiple options given to the user, they are able to add, delete, find, and print all data stored in the database."

This project is a demonstration of the many different skills that I learned from ICS 212 ranging from linked lists to a small taste of front end and back end programming. When the user runs the program, they will interact with it strictly through the console. The program has a menu option that allows the user to select what they want to do. The menu options include, add bank record, delete bank record, find bank record, or print all bank records. Depending on whether the user selected add or delete, a bank record will either be deleted or added into a linked list based on increasing order of bank account numbers. Using the find or print all options prints the desired output of record(s) to the screen. With quit being their 5th option, they can choose to exit the program and save all to a save folder stored in their computer. When the program starts up again, the program will read from the save file and deposit them back into the linked list.

I completed this project through my ICS 212 course that I took in my 3rd year at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. This project was one of the big projects that were to be completed towards the end of the semester as a way to test the knowledge and skills we aquired from the start of the semester. This semester was the first time I had learned C or C++, prior to this project I only knew how to code in strictly Java. Because I spent almost an entire month working on the project through my class, I'm more well equipped to work with C/C++ than I was a couple months ago.
