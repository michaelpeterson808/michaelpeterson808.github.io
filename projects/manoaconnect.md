## Overview

  ManoaConnectTB, is a school project made for my ICS 314 class and was our final project for the course. The team that created this project consisted of six people, and we all had unique sets of skills that we brought to the project. Manoa Connect is a way for clubs at the University of Hawai’i at Manoa to connect with their students, by allowing people to create accounts for their clubs, allowing students to follow that club to keep track of their posts for upcoming events. This website took heavy inspiration from various other social media websites like Instagram and Facebook. There is also a feature for an individual, not in a club, to make a post on the website as well. 

## Contributions

  My contributions to Manoa Connect were less significant than my group mates, as we all agreed that it was difficult to spread around the workload evenly. My notable contributions to the website were, fixing bugs, creating interface elements, and testing. Although my contributions were small, I still was able to be a part of the team, and my small contributions were able to push our team to success in putting out a good project. Most of my group members had prior experience working in a team programming setting like this before. For me, this was my first group coding project, and I learned a lot from it.

## Learning Experience
	
  As previously mentioned, Manoa Connect was my very first programming experience working in a group, and I think learning how to work together in a team with other programmers was a great first experience. Using the GitHub issue based project management, we were able to work on one main project by creating multiple branches based on created issues.’ These issues were created collectively by us, and decided where which issue went to which person. Secondly, learning how to create a website was also a very important learning experience, as I got first hand experience with working with Nextjs, React, and following coding standards using ESLint. Overall, this project was a great first step into getting into the software engineering world, and I can’t wait to use my experience from this project for future projects to come.
