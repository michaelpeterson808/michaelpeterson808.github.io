In my third year of university, I’m finally taking a software engineering course and through it, I hope to find some guidance as to where I want my career to go. Ever since the start of my university career, I’ve wanted to pursue a career in computer science, I just wasn’t sure what I wanted to do within the field. All the classes I’ve taken before my new software engineering class have been about strengthening skills in programming languages like Java, C, and C++, they mostly never had any information about what actual programmers do in a working environment. Through this class, I aim to find a career that I want to pursue, create connections with new people, and develop valuable skills that will help me in the future.

## Branching out
Taking this new class has increased my interest in software engineering through the first week of the course. What also has me interested in software engineering is the work. I want to know what kind of work I will do because this may be what I do as a career for the rest of my life. From the many different projects I’ll be doing in software engineering, I hope it develops the skills I need to prosper. Through working on group projects, I hope to find new skills in teamwork and leadership, as well as form new friendships and connections with my peers in my class. If I want to do well in the field of computer science I’m sure that working well in a team is a great trait to have. Having as many connections as possible can also be a good thing because it presents you with a lot more opportunities.

## The Takeaways.
Since I’ve been pretty lost as to what I want to do in computer science, I hope that through software engineering, I find the path that’s right for me. I aim to use all the skills I develop within software engineering and use it for jobs and courses that I plan on taking in the future. Jobs in software engineering pay very well, and it’s a goal to have a well-paying job as a day job. Even if software engineering might not be for me, it will help me in the right direction in my search for a career.
