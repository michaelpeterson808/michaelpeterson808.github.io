As someone who had almost no prior experience programming in JavaScript, learning TypeScript was definitely an interesting, yet challenging experience. Like learning any new programming language, getting used to the syntax was definitely a challenge to overcome, but once I got over that, I started to see some of the advantages of programming in this new language. 

Before learning TypeScript and JavaScript, the programming languages I was most familiar with were Java, C, and C++ from my prior programming classes I took in University. In the end, learning TypeScript has mainly highlighted a couple ideas to me, like how TypeScript compares to the languages I knew prior, how the language can be good from a software engineering perspective, and ultimately how a new style of learning in my software engineering class will change how I learn new material.

## Learning TypeScript From the Bottom Up 
When I was taking the introductory modules on learning TypeScript, learning the new syntax was the biggest challenge for me. Constantly looking back into my notes to see what the correct syntax for creating methods was definitely a burden and took a while to get used to. Another challenge that was hard to get around was the concept of “destructure assignments”, which was completely new to me because I only had prior knowledge in Java and C/C++, but with a lot of practice and time, I was able to understand it significantly better. However, what I really like about TypeScript when comparing to my previously known languages is the flexibility in the method return types. 

Having more than one return type in a function was such a revelation for me because I thought it was impossible. That means there is so much more versatility in programs that can be created within TypeScript. I definitely think with a lot more practice and programs completed under TypeScript, I could significantly increase my skills in software development.

## As a Software Developer 
From a software engineering perspective, I think that TypeScript would be a great skill to have. Since a lot of modern day websites use JavaScript as their main programming language, it would be a perfect skill for a software developer to know TypeScript. 

After just starting my Software Engineering class in University, it changed the way I have approached learning new material with the new flipped classroom style. Rather than learning most of the material in class, we spend time outside of class learning the material ourselves. This gives us more time in class to practice the skills we learned at home under the guidance of the instructor, who can help reinforce our understanding. This style of learning is a lot different from what I’m used to, but I see it being very advantageous in the future. Because more time is spent learning material outside of class, it’s a way to better strengthen our learning by getting more repetition in practice. This definitely helps reduce overall stress in school and could provide a valuable skill in my career path of Software Engineering.
